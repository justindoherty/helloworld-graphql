# helloworld-graphql
The goal of this repository is to try out GraphQL to become familiar with the technology to possibly apply it toward future projects

## Setup
### Server
The server will be a [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) server because it is supposed to be simple to setup. I will then use [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java) for the server side GraphQL implementation.

### Client
The client will be done in [Angular](https://angular.io/) and use the [Apollo Client](http://dev.apollodata.com/). I've chosen [Angular](https://angular.io/) because it is the most likely client side framework that I'd use in the near future for a new project.

## Goals
* Call a GraphQL endpoint from within an Angular application
* Push updates to a query from the server and have the Angular application update
* Explore paging and filtering
* How do types work in an Angular application since GraphQL allows for partial data
